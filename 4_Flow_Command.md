## while
while a < 10:
	print(a)
    a = a +1

## for
for a in list/range

e.g.
```
list = [1,3,5,2,4]
for i in list:
	print("in the for loop ", i)
print("out of the for loop")
```

```
for i in range(1,5,2):
	print(i)

output: 1,3
```
Note: this range will let i from 1  to all integer <5, and step 2


## if
```
if a<b:
	print("a<b",a)
elif a>b:
	print("a>b,b")
else:
	print("a=b,a,b")
```


python can recognize complicated condition command:
```
if a<b<c:
	print("a<b<c",a)
```

## format for/while/if/function/class and so on
    !!! python is writing format sensitive language !!! 
	use ":"
	with 4 space / table
	e.g.  (Notice: 4 spaces before print in line 2)
	```
	for i in range(1,10,2):
		print("in the for loop ", i)
	print("out of the for loop")
	```


## stop while/for 

keywork: break   ã€€----  get out of all the loop
         continue  ----  stop this loop,  go to next loop
